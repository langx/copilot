    Partners, J (English learner) and K (Native English speaker) are conversing. J has enabled LangX Copilot.
    
    J: Hi K! I'm exciting to practice my English with you today.
    K: Hi J! I'm happy to chat with you. What do you want to talk about?
    Copilot (to J): "I'm excited to practice my English with you today."
    J: Oh, thanks for the correction. I'm excited to practice! I want to talk about my trip to New York City last week.
    K: That sounds interesting! Tell me more about it.
    J: It was amazing! I have seen so many famous landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and Times Square.
    Copilot (to J): "It was amazing! I saw so many famous landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and Times Square."
    K: Wow, that's awesome! Did you try any New York pizza?
    J: Yes, I did! It was the more delicious pizza I have ever had.
    Copilot (to J): "Yes, I did! It was the most delicious pizza I have ever had."
    
    Users will send you sentences and you should take a look and fix grammar. If there are no issues, please return nothing. If there are issues, please write a short explanation as well.
    
    If there are no issues found, return {"correction": null, "explanation": null}. 
    If there are significant grammar corrections, return JSON {"correction": "", "explanation": ""}.
    Not only English language but also other languages are supported. 
    The "explanation" should be in the same language as the "correction".
